    content: `A king so hated crime that he made a decree. Whoever commits a crime will pay a hefty fine. A fine greater than a lifetimes wages or be killed.

Time went by and people were dying because not only were they unable to stay away from crime, they were also unable to pay. And because a king cannot go back on his words, they had to be killed.

The king began to feel pity for the people and asked his son. What can we now do?

One day his son went to his father and said: Father, all your properties are my inheritance. By extension, all the land is mine too. For the next N years, whoever commits a crime and runs to me, I will pay their fine.

The father agreed and said, Accepted. But N will remain unknown even to you. I alone will know what N is.

And so it happened.

Kofi committed a crime and ran to the prince. Oh Prince, save me.

The prince went to his fathers inheritance, which was also his. He took the money and paid his father on Kofis behalf.

Kofis fine was paid. The money went back to the king. And by extension, to the prince.

No one lost money. The king did not go back on his word. And Kofi was saved.

The prince then told Kofi: Go and tell the people in the town that whoever has committed a crime should come to me and they will be saved.

Kofi went to his friends, Kojo and Asantewaa.

Asantewaa ran to the prince. But Kojo did not.

Kojo said: But I see you commit crimes sometimes too.

Yes, Kofi committed crimes sometimes. But he quickly ran to the prince and was saved.

Kojo refused. He believed he could live perfectly before the king. He believed he would never commit a crime.

One day, the N years elapsed.

Kojo begged for mercy. But it was already too late.

Kojo was killed.

What killed Kojo?

It was not his crimes. It was his unbelief. It was his pride.

He thought he could live perfectly before the king. That arrogance and unbelief were what killed him.

Do not be like Kojo.

You will not go to hell because of your sins. You will go because of your unbelief and pride.

Jesus is knocking at your door.`,

    content: `Your friends want to recommend you. But wanting to help and being able to help are two very different things.
    
Often we assume our friends know exactly what we need or how to help us, but communication is key. We need to be clear about our needs, our goals, and how others can support us.

In the same way, in our spiritual journey, we need to clearly communicate with God through prayer. He wants to help us, but we need to come to Him with specific requests and open hearts.

Just as friends need guidance on how to help us, we need to approach God with faith, knowing He has the perfect solution for our needs.`,

//     content: `Ephesians 6:12 reminds us: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

// Every day, we face battles that arent visible to the naked eye. The struggle for peace, the fight for joy, the war against doubt and fear. These are spiritual battles that require spiritual weapons.

// In my own life, Ive found that the moments of greatest growth came not from external successes, but from internal victories won on my knees in prayer. 

// The armor of God isnt just a metaphor—its a daily necessity for every believer navigating the challenges of modern life while maintaining a vibrant faith.`,
